Title : How to set up ssh keys for GitHub repository.

This documentation is on how to set up ssh keys on your computer
so that you can communicate with GitHub repository. 

Please note this document is based on Windows OS.
And use GitBash linux shell wrapper for windows (i.e. Cygwin)


First check existing ssh keys in the computer.

$ cd ~/.ssh
# Checks to see if there is a directory named ".ssh" in your user directory


In this case if there is any existing ssh keys you need to back-up to a separate folder using basic linux commands.

Use following command to generate ssh key value pairs.
Follow interactive wizard.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"

Above will generate ssh public key(with *.pub)

Use the following command to copy public key to clipboard.

$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Log on GitHub account and add new ssh key and paste the key content.

One this is done you have configured ssh keys to be able to communicate with git@github.com server and your client machine.

Please note when using commands use git@github.com:tmnuwan12/Java_Projects as the repository name.
